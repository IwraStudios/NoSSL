# NoSSL

This repository is for a project I created a long ago as an easy way to setup SSLstrip and SSLsplit so here it is.


```javascript
usage: [ba[sh]] ./OpenBot[debug].sh [--strip]  [--split]
**DO NOT** use strip and split at the same time
```

**WARNING** to use the SSLsplit requires to have it installed, Kali 2016.2 recommended

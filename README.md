# NoSSL

This repository is for a project I created a long ago as an easy way to setup SSLstrip and SSLsplit so here it is.


```javascript
usage: [ba[sh]] ./OpenBot[debug].sh [--strip]  [--split]
DO NOT use --strip and --split at the same time
```

**WARNINGS** 
* ONLY use an networks where you are allowed to test it on(e.g. pen-tester)
* to use the SSLsplit requires to have it installed, Kali 2016.2 recommended
